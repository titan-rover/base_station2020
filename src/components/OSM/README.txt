the OSM folder contains the Open Map Tile image 'osm-...us-midwist.mbtile' image in the "tile" subfolder meant to be used as an offline map, however, 
when starting the html file 'local_tiles.html' there is a load error of the image resulting in the pink layer
- Need to find a way to extract mbtile file into something usable -
- Read it might be an issue with Firefox
- Issues with uploading the tile file (size limit) might be faster to sign up and download the file from Open Map Tiles yourself.


map box.html is a map example using mapboxGL; works like any other html file (run on browser). 
my api keyfor mapbox included in file.
might have to "npm install mapbox-gl --save" beforehand
